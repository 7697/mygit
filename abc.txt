 I see the goodness of life,
 and you for me, you are so important,
 and you together of dribs and drabs,
 like sunshine every day,
 let me feel warm and happiness.
 You are my all over the world.
 I want to accompany in your side,
 forever and ever in the grandchildren, grow old together.
 Still can see the scenery,holding your hand.
 It is the biggest wishes in my life.
 love you.

 我看到了生命的美好，
 你对我来说是如此的重要，
 和你在一起的点点滴滴，
 每天像阳光一样，
 让我感到温暖和幸福。
 你是我的全世界，我想陪在你身边，
 子孙满堂，一起变老，
 仍然可以握住你的手，去看风景，
 这是我一生中最大的愿望。
 爱你。
